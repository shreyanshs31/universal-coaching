What is a stack data structure?
Ans1. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle

How does a stack differ from a queue?
A stack follows a "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one removed, while a queue follows a "First In, First Out" (FIFO) principle

What are the basic operations that can be performed on a stack?
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack
IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty
Top: Displays the top element of the stack

What is the time complexity of the push operation on a stack?
The time complexity of the "push" operation on a stack is O(1)

What is the time complexity of the pop operation on a stack?
The time complexity of the pop operation on a stack is O(1)

What is the purpose of the peek operation on a stack?
To display the topmost element in the stack.

How do you implement a dynamic stack that can grow or shrink as needed?
dynamic stack that can grow or shrink as needed, you typically use a linked list as the underlying data structure

How do you implement a stack with a maximum size limit?
using default
